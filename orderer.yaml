    # Bootstrap method: The method by which to obtain the bootstrap block
    # system channel is specified. The option can be one of:
    #   "file" - path to a file containing the genesis block or config block of system channel
    #   "none" - allows an orderer to start without a system channel configuration
    BootstrapMethod: file

    # Bootstrap file: The file containing the bootstrap block to use when
    # initializing the orderer system channel and BootstrapMethod is set to
    # "file".  The bootstrap file can be the genesis block, and it can also be
    # a config block for late bootstrap of some consensus methods like Raft.
    # Generate a genesis block by updating $FABRIC_CFG_PATH/configtx.yaml and
    # using configtxgen command with "-outputBlock" option.
    # Defaults to file "genesisblock" (in $FABRIC_CFG_PATH directory) if not specified.
